      	<p>Compared to the various landscapes within the modern city, such as skyscrapers, hurried crowds, bustling shopping malls and even shared bicycles at every corner... The bite marks of the worms are really not very noticeable. Walking in the city often requires you to be associated with a purpose—going to a restaurant, attending a lecture, taking a car to a certain location- and during this process our eyes are less likely to focus on tiny things, let alone on a leaf with a worm bite hole. Hence, we wanted to organise a "worm walk" to invite everyone to switch into different perspectives to experience that which exists around us.<br>
			<br>
           By walking in the nature,people collect leaves with leaf miner’s mark,worm wholes or any other patterns, they will use those as a “key-frame” for their animated zine.<br>
            <br>
